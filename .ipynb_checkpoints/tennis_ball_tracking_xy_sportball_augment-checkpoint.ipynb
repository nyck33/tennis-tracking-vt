    "# Tennis Ball Tracking with Vision Transformer\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will outline the steps to fine-tune a Vision Transformer (ViT) model for the task of tracking a tennis ball in video frames. The goal is to predict the x, y coordinates of the tennis ball and the event type (flying, bouncing, being hit) in each frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we will use is provided by TrackNet and contains broadcast TV tennis match videos along with accompanying .csv files that annotate the x, y location of the tennis ball and the event type in each frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps we will follow are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation:** Extract frames from the videos and save them as individual images. The labels for each image (the x, y coordinates of the tennis ball and the event type) will be extracted from the accompanying .csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preprocessing:** Preprocess the images to be in the format expected by the Vision Transformer model. This typically involves resizing the images to the expected input size of the model (224x224 for the base Vision Transformer model), and normalizing the pixel values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Preparation:** Load the pre-trained Vision Transformer model, and modify its final layer to match the number of output classes for our tasks. For the x, y coordinate prediction task, we will add a fully connected layer with 2 output units (for the x and y coordinates). For the event type prediction task, we will add a fully connected layer with 3 output units (for the 3 event types), followed by a softmax activation function.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training Loop:** Define a training loop where we feed the preprocessed images to the model, compute the loss for both tasks (using a suitable loss function for each task), and update the model's weights based on the total loss. The total loss will be a weighted sum of the two individual losses, where the weights reflect the importance of each task.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Evaluation:** After training the model for a certain number of epochs, we will evaluate its performance on a validation set. We will compute the loss and accuracy for each task, and adjust the model's hyperparameters or the training process as needed to improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Inference:** Once we are satisfied with the model's performance, we can use it to predict the x, y coordinates and event type of the tennis ball in new video frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!"

    "### ImageNet normalization used\n",
    "However, when using pre-trained models like the Vision Transformer google/vit-base-patch16-224, it's important to match the preprocessing steps that were applied to the data during the model's original training. In this case, the model was trained on the ImageNet dataset, which was normalized using the specific mean and standard deviation values for the RGB channels that I mentioned earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, while normalizing to the range {0,1} is not wrong per se, it might not yield the best results when using this specific pre-trained model. The model might perform better if the input images are normalized in the same way the training data was normalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I would recommend adjusting your normalization step to match the ImageNet normalization:"

For example, the RandomHorizontalFlip transform uses a fixed random state, so the same images will always be flipped. If you want truly random flipping, you might need to implement your own flipping transform. Also, this code assumes that the 'x' coordinate is the first element in the label array, and that it is a value between 0 and 1 representing the relative position of the ball in the frame. If your data is different, you would need to adjust the code accordingly."
